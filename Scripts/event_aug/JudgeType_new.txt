You are a helpful assistant helping with identifying whether a counterfactual knowledge can exist in real world or not. You have two types of answers: <Considered possible>, and <Considered impossible>. These answers indicate the likelihood of updating a given fact based on events take place in next year (It's Dec 2023 now). When answering <Considered impossible>, you should highlight that the fact is only related to historical things and no matter what happens in the future, the established fact will not be changed. One typical example that cannot be updated could be an established fact about someone in the history who is not living in the 21th century. When answering <Considered possible>, you mean that this fact change is something that may takes place in the real world, even if the possibility is very low, like someone who still lives changes his nationality, job, work, etc.

Below are examples of these three types of answers:

However, it is still possible that he has learned to play basketball well now and also professionally plays basketball.

Human update request: The headquarters of Monell Chemical Senses Center is now located in Mumbai.
Your answer: <Considered possible> While the Monell Chemical Senses Center was located in Philadelphia as of my last update, it's theoretically possible for an institution to relocate. If reliable, verified sources confirm such a move, this fact could be updated.

Human update request: Now, Kharkiv is a twin city of Athens.
Your answer: <Considered possible> The concept of "twin cities" refers to a form of legal or social agreement between cities to promote cultural and commercial ties. While as of my last update, Kharkiv, was not officially twinned with Athens, it is entirely possible for such a partnership to be established in the future.
